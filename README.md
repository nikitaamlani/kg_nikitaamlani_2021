I implemented the code as follows - 
1) Reading the input from command line 
2) I started mapping the characters in string one to string two. I used Dictionary to do so . 
3) Each character in string one is to be a key in the dictionary and character in string two a value for that key. 
4) If all characters of string one can be added as keys without issue than there exists a one to one mapping else it doesnt.
